   <h1>Abstract</h1>
   <p>
      This paper suggests an approach to tangible interaction design that builds
      on the idea of <i>cultural forms</i>. Specifically, I propose that designers
      can shape objects and situations to <i>evoke</i> cultural forms as a means
      to tap into users' existing cognitive, physical, and emotional resources.
      The emphasis is less on improving the usability of an interface and more
      on improving the overall experience around an interactive artifact by
      cueing productive patterns of social activity. My use of the term cultural
      form is derived from the work of Geoffrey Saxe and his form-function shift
      framework. This framework describes a process through which individuals
      appropriate cultural forms and restructure them over time to serve new
      functions in light of shifting goals and expectations. I describe Saxe's
      framework and then illustrate the use of cultural forms in design with
      three examples.

   <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>
      Researchers in tangible interaction wrestle with difficult questions related to
      the design of interactive systems: <i>What aspects of design lead to "natural"
      and "intuitive" interaction? How can we create experiences that are meaningful,
      emotional, or memorable? How do we support productive collaboration among
      friends and colleagues or among strangers in a crowd?</i>
   </p>
      <!-- 
I'm adopting this term from the work of Geoff Saxe, a learning scientists.
I'm trying to apply his theories to tangible interaction design.
         
      How do we design for situations in which the quality of social interaction
      is at least as important as usability? In places like museums, parks,
      coffee shops, and living rooms, social arrangements can be fluid and
      unpredictable, and friends and families often mix with strangers and
      crowds [<cite ref="horn-2012b"></cite>, <cite ref="hornecker-2005"></cite>,
      <cite ref="hornecker-2010"></cite>, <cite ref="marshall-2011a"></cite>,
      <cite ref="marshall-2011b"></cite>]. Productively engaging groups of people in
      these settings (and not just individuals) can be critical to the success
      or failure of a design.
      What tools do we, as designers, have to
      help structure the activity that takes place around an interactive system?

      Don Norman, for example, proposes the use of <i>social signifiers</i>,
      perceivable cues that suggest social activity or appropriate
      social behavior [<cite ref="norman-2008"></cite>]. Likewise, Hornecker
      proposes <i>embodied facilitation</i> as a means to influence
      behavior patterns and social configurations [<cite ref="hornecker-2005"></cite>].
      
This paper expands on these ideas and suggest an approach to tangible
      interaction design that builds on cultural foundations rather than on more
      universal aspects of human experience with the physical world.      
      -->
   <p>
      This paper considers these questions from the perspective of
      <i>cultural forms</i>. In particular, I propose that interaction designers
      can intentionally shape objects and situations to <i>evoke</i> cultural forms
      as a means to tap into users' existing cognitive, physical, and emotional
      resources. The emphasis is less on improving the usability of an interface
      and more on improving the overall experience around an interactive
      artifact by cueing productive patterns of social activity.
   </p>
   <div style="width: 3.35in; height: 0.8in;"></div>
   <p>
      My use of the
      term cultural form is derived from the work of Geoffrey Saxe and the
      <i>form-function shift framework</i> [<cite ref="saxe-1991"></cite>, <cite
      ref="saxe-1999"></cite>]. This framework describes a process through which
      individuals appropriate cultural forms and restructure them over time to
      serve new functions in light of shifting goals and expectations. Cultural
      forms refers to social constructions or conventions that are linked to
      recurrent patterns of activity. Examples include things like counting
      systems, games, and currency systems. Cultural forms can involve 
      physical artifacts (as in card games) or they can consist entirely of
      patterns of social activity (as in games like hide-and-seek). The use of
      cultural forms is especially relevant for tangible interaction
      because physcial and social embodiment [<cite ref="dourish-2001"></cite>,
      <cite ref="hornecker-2005"></cite>, <cite ref="hornecker-2010"></cite>]
      creates unique opportunities for designers to shape objects and situations
      to evoke existing cultural forms in highly recognizable ways. Below I
      describe Saxe's framework in more detail and then present three example
      systems that both build on cultural forms while at the same time
      suggesting novel functions and capabilities for which they might be used. 
   </p>
   <h2>A Thought Experiment</h2>
   <p>
      Before getting too far into the details, a short thought experiment will
      help illustrate what I mean by cultural forms. To begin, imagine a small
      group of elementary school children in a room. Now, imagine that a
      researcher walks into the room, places a coil of rope on a table, and
      then leaves without saying anything. What happens next?
   </p>

   <p>
      Maybe the kids play with the rope or tie it in knots. Maybe they organize
      a game of tug-of-war or just ignore the rope altogether. The point I want
      to convey is that it's not easy to predict what will happen, and it probably
      depends a great deal on the kids themselves and the dynamics of the group.
   </p>
      
   <p>
      Now let's repeat the experiment. As before, there's a small group of
      children in a room. A researcher places a coil of rope on a table and then
      walks away. The difference is that this time there are wooden handles
      attached to the two ends of the rope (Figure 1). What happens now?
      The outcome will still vary depending on the kids themselves, but we can
      be a bit more confident in predicting the outcome. We might see individual
      kids jumping rope, or maybe two kids will swing the rope while a third
      tries to jump without getting tripped up. And, depending on where the kids
      come from, they might sing rhythmic songs in time with the rope or enact
      elaborate rules for taking turns.
   </p>

   <p>
      So what changed between the two trials? One argument is that the
      affordances of the object changed&#151;that the handles attached to the rope
      now afford grasping, swinging, and jumping. But this explanation is
      unsatisfactory because a rope without handles can still easily be used
      as a jump rope. A slightly different explanation is that the kids now
      <i>perceive</i> the object in a different way. In this interpretation, the
      rope with handles affords because it is perceived as a jumprope, whereas
      the rope without handles is not. While this might be an acceptable explanation, the use of the
      term <i>affordance</i> places an emphasis on the object itself and how the
      object might be used. But, what's interesting about this example is not
      the rope itself, or even that the kids use it to jump with. What's
      interesting is the complex forms of social interaction that effortlessly
      coalesces around the jump rope as a cultural artifact. As Norman has
      pointed out, the concept of affordance fails to capture the full
      implications of phenomena like this [<cite ref="norman-2008"></cite>].
      The explanation I propose is that the rope with handles evokes a strong
      and recognizable <i>cultural form</i> that, in turn, activates intricate
      patterns of social activity. With these patterns of activity come
      associated physical, cognitive, and emotional resources that individuals
      apply to the situation. In this paper I expand on these ideas and
      illustrate the use of cultural forms in tangible interaction design.

   <h1>Background</h1>
   <p>
      Much of the research on "natural" and "intuitive" interaction has focused on
      universal (or near universal) aspects of human experience. For example, the
      Reality-Based Interaction (RBI) framework proposes that designers can
      build on users' understanding of the "natural" world at four levels:
      na&iuml;ve physics, body awareness and skills, environment awareness and
      skills, and social awareness and skills [<cite ref="jacob-2008"></cite>].
      Similarly, research on Natural User Interfaces (NUI) emphasizes
      interaction that can create "fluid, natural experiences by mimicking
      real-world physical interactions and augmenting them beyond what is possible
      in the real world" [<cite ref="wigdor-2011"></cite>].
   </p>
      
<!--
Furthermore, as Hornecker points out, even though much of the
      excitement surrounding tangible interaction has to do with its supposed
      ability to facilitate collaboration, we lack design tools that help put
      existing patterns of social activity to use in creating effective
      collaborative interaction
      [<cite ref="hornecker-2005"></cite>].
      
The RBI framework provides several examples that
      take advantage of social awareness and skills, but it does not offer
      specific guidelines for activating these skills on the part of users.
      
      Wigdor and Wixon also point out the growing importance of support for
      colocated social interaction in NUIs [<cite ref="wigdor-2011"></cite>].
      
Hornecker argues that "relying on
      affordances in design is far from straightforward." Not only can
      "affordances [...] go unnoticed if they do not fit with real-world
      experience and cultural knowledge" but it is also difficult to "restrict
      the set of affordances of a physical interface to those intended by the
      designer" [<cite ref="hornecker-2012"></cite>].
      
      Norman suggests that we can take advantage of perceptible indicators in
      the physical or social world to cue productive social activity through
      <i>social signifiers</i> [<cite ref="norman-2008"></cite>]. These are cues
      in our everyday environment that help us interpet situations and coordinate
      activity with other people. In a similar vein, Hornecker describes ways in
      which designers can support embodied facilitation: "We can interpret
      systems as spaces or structures to act and move in, thereby determining
      usage options and behavior patterns" [<cite ref="hornecker-2005"></cite>].
      Hornecker's specific strategies include offering embodied constraints,
      multiple access points, and tailored representations [<cite
      ref="hornecker-2005"></cite>].
   </p>
-->
   <p>
      Along these lines, Hurtienne and Israel propose a continuum of pre-existing
      knowledge that includes innate, sensorimotor, cultural, and knowledge
      derived from domain expertise [<cite ref="hurtienne-2007"></cite>]. And,
      while acknowledging the role of culture, they explicitly emphasize the
      sensorimotor end of the continuum in an effort to be more universally
      applicable: "the further we rise towards the top level of
      the continuum, the higher the degree of specialization of knowledge and
      the smaller the potential number of users..."
      [<cite ref="hurtienne-2007"></cite>] (p. 128).
   </p>
   <p>
      The work of Hurtienne & Israel has also contributed to a recent interest
      in the use of embodied metaphor as a foundation for intuitive tangible
      interaction design [<cite ref="antle-2009"></cite>, <cite
      ref="bakker-2012"></cite>, <cite ref="hurtienne-2007"></cite>, <cite
      ref="hurtienne-2009"></cite>, <cite ref="macaranas-2012"></cite>]. This
      area of work builds on theories of embodied cognition (e.g. [<cite
      ref="lakoff-2003"></cite>]) that suggest that everyday sensory-motor
      experiences, starting in infancy, form the metaphorical foundation through
      which we understand a wide variety of abstract concepts. Much of the
      appeal of embodied metaphor comes from the idea that we can take advantage
      of emerging interactive technology to design more intuitive mappings
      between physical actions and abstract concepts. As such, this research has
      focused on universal aspects of human experience that cut across
      cultural contexts (e.g. metaphor population stereotypes [<cite
      ref="hurtienne-2009"></cite>, <cite ref="macaranas-2012"></cite>]).
   </p>
   <h2>Beyond Universals</h2>
   <p>
      While a focus on universality might be valuable for creating broadly
      applicable designs, it also underplays the substantial role of cultural in
      shaping our engagement with world around us at a physical and social
      level. Within the tangible community, Hornecker has critiqued the
      assumption that tangibles are more natural or intuitive due to affordances
      rooted in physicality and our everyday experiences with the real world
      [<cite ref="hornecker-2012"></cite>]. Along similar lines, Norman has
      critiqued the use of the term <i>natural</i> in reference to gestural
      interaction [<cite ref="norman-2010"></cite>]: "Most gestures are neither
      natural nor easy to learn or remember. Few are innate or readily
      pre-disposed to rapid and easy learning. Even the simple headshake is
      puzzling when cultures intermix" [<cite ref="norman-2010"></cite>].
   </p>
   <p>
      Many researchers have instead argued that it is important to create
      systems that are responsive or sensitive to social and cultural factors
      (e.g.
      [<cite ref="dillenbourg-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="dourish-2001"></cite>,
      <cite ref="gonzalez-2005"></cite>,
      <cite ref="hornecker-2005"></cite>,
      <cite ref="hornecker-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="lee-2003"></cite>,
      <cite ref="mackay-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="marshall-2011a"></cite>,
      <cite ref="marshall-2011b"></cite>,
      <cite ref="norman-2008"></cite>,
      <cite ref="strengers-2011"></cite>,
      <cite ref="suchman-2007"></cite>]).       
      For example, Dourish's notion of <i>embodied interaction</i> looks beyond
      universal aspects of human experience and attempts to capture the complex
      relationship between interaction, objects, and meaning as it is
      constructed through social and cultural practice: "The analytic
      exploration of embodied interaction has repeatedly uncovered the way that
      objects carry meaning on multiple levels: as entities in their own right,
      as signifiers of social meaning, as elements in systems of practice [...]"
      [<cite ref="dourish-2001"></cite>] (p.166).

      An influential example is Mackay's study of air traffic controllers and
      their use of paper flight
      strips to coordinate work as a team [<cite ref="mackay-2000"></cite>].
      She notes that "[t]he current paper-based system supports safe and
      effective work practices and offers a level of flexibility difficult to
      imagine with traditional computer-based interfaces" [<cite
      ref="mackay-2000"></cite>] (p. 336). A key insight is to create technology
      that fit within existing practices that have evolved within specific
      communities. Another example is Dillenbourg's concept of classroom
      orchestration [<cite ref="dillenbourg-2010"></cite>]. Dillenbourg argues
      that technology should both work with and augment existing classroom
      practices in order to support usability at the level of the classrooms,
      not just at the level of individuals or small groups [<cite
      ref="dillenbourg-2010"></cite>]. Similarly, Lee's cultural modeling design
      framework [<cite ref="lee-2003"></cite>] advocates for the design of
      learning environments that are responsive to school students' cultural
      funds of knowledge [<cite ref="gonzalez-2005"></cite>] and socially
      constructed ways of knowing. She demonstrates the application of this
      framework in the design of a multi-media literacy environment that is
      responsive to the sociocul-tural resources of students in schools
      [<cite ref="lee-2003"></cite>].
   </p>
      
   <h2>Form-Function Shift Framework</h2>
   <p>
      The term "cultural form" is derived from the work of Geoff Saxe and
      his form-function shift framework [<cite ref="saxe-1991"></cite>,
      <cite ref="saxe-1999"></cite>]. Saxe developed this theories through the
      study of diverse groups of people engaged with cultural concepts and
      artifacts. These groups included children selling candy on city streets in
      Brazil; adults engaging in economic exchanges with Western currency
      systems in remote areas of Papua New Guinea; and children studying
      fractions in elementary schools. Using these studies as a foundation, Saxe
      explains how individuals appropriate existing cultural forms and
      restructure them to serve new functions over time in light of shifting
      goals and expectations.
   </p>
      
   <h2>Cultural Forms</h2>
   <p>
      Central to Saxe's framework is the notion of cultural forms, which he
      defines as historically elaborated social constructions and conventions
      [<cite ref="saxe-1991"></cite>]. Examples include things like counting
      systems, games, and monetary systems. Cultural forms can involve the use
      of physical artifacts (as in activities like jumping rope), or they can
      consist entirely of patterns of activity (as in games like hide-and-seek).
      Cultural forms are inherently linked to social practices. In other words,
      artifacts like a jigsaw puzzle or a $20 bill are nothing more than bits of
      paper and cardboard in the absence of recurrent, socially organized
      activities that give them meaning. So, when I open a jigsaw
      puzzle box and dump the pieces on a table, I not only have a specific goal
      in mind (assembling the puzzle), I also have a set of physical and
      cognitive skills that can be coordinated in a routine behavior to achieve
      that goal. And, unless I happen to be alone, dumping the puzzle pieces on
      the table is also a communicative act, a sort of open invitation to the
      people around me to partake in a shared endeavor that involves
      corresponding social resources as well. These resources include things
      like establishing common ground, negotiating goals and sub-goals, and
      resolving disputes.
   </p>
   <p>
      In a way the jigsaw puzzle is just an excuse to spend time with friends
      and family, to talk and joke and to be physically close. The broader point
      is that through cultural forms, people coordinate activities and resources
      to accomplish goals. But, these goals are diverse, multi-layered, and
      constantly in flux. As Saxe puts it: "Not only do individuals shape and
      reshape their goals as practices take form in everyday life, but they also
      construct goals that vary in character as a function of the knowledge that
      they bring to practices" [<cite ref="saxe-1991"></cite>] (p.17).
   </p>
   <p>
      My use of the term cultural forms implies social practices and activities
      that can take place at different levels of granularity. For example,
      Sherin proposes the term <i>micro-practices</i> to describe "stereotypical
      activities, varying in length from a few minutes to a few hours, in which
      a handful of individuals participate as the main actors." [<cite
      ref="sherin-2004"></cite>]. Micro-practices include things like
      going fishing, bowling, or playing board games. Many of the cultural
      forms that I use as examples in this paper involve social activities that
      could be described as micro-practices.
   </p>
   <p>
      One last note on cultural forms is that they persist in societies and
      cultures over relatively long periods of time&#151;at least long enough to
      achieve a degree of stability. Of course, as cultures and technologies
      change, new forms arise, old forms die off, and existing forms evolve and
      transform. One implication of this observation is that in order for forms
      to persist, they must have some built-in means of self-replication&#151; some
      way in which they are passed on from person to person over time. For this
      to happen, the social activities implicit in cultural forms involve
      elaborate mechanisms for teaching and learning. There are a few excellent
      examples of this in the Learning Sciences literature. For example, Nasir's
      study of the sociocultural practices in the game of dominoes reveals
      subtle ways in which peers teach each other strategic
      approaches to play that go well beyond the rules of the game itself
      [<cite ref="nasir-2005"></cite>]. Likewise, Stevens' study of children
      playing video games in homes describes a variety of sophisticated learning
      arrangements in which kids teach and learn from each other through play
      [<cite ref="satwicz-2008"></cite>, <cite ref="stevens-2007"></cite>].
   </p>
   <h1>CULTURAL FORMS IN INTERACTION DESIGN</h1>
   <p>
      Using Saxe's shift framework as a starting point, I propose that cultural
      forms provide a useful foundation for interaction design (and tangible
      interaction design in particular). When designers create systems that
      evoke cultural forms, they tap into existing resources on the part of
      individuals that not only increase usability, but also create
      meaningful experiences with other people around an interface.
   </p>
   </div>

   <p>
      This perspective diverges from notions of affordance and metaphor
      as they are commonly conceived in HCI research. Norman describes
      affordances as "the perceived and actual properties of the thing,
      primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing
      could possibly be used" [<cite ref="norman-1988"></cite>] (p.9). His
      definition emphasizes the object itself and ways in which the object
      might be used. Of course, users must perceive the cultural form in an
      object or an artifact for it to be useful. If I don't recognize a piece
      of paper (like a $20 bill) as monetary currency, then it's just a piece
      of paper. That piece of paper has certain affordances: it affords writing,
      folding, crumpling, and so on. But as a $20 bill, the paper has meaning in
      terms of the cultural practices that involve the storing and exchange of
      currency for goods and services. More recently, Norman has proposed the
      term <i>social signifiers</i> to refer to physical or social indicators
      that cue productive social activity [<cite ref="norman-2008"></cite>].
   </p>
   <p>
      Of course both a rectangular piece of paper and a $20 bill can be thought
      of as cultural artifacts. The important point is that there are different
      sets of practice-linked resources associated with them. This leads to the
      second observation that cultural forms are culturally specific. Forms that
      make sense in one context are not recognized in other contexts, or are not
      recognized in quite the same way. Likewise, the practices surrounding the
      same object might be quite different in different situations. As with
      affordances and metaphors, cultural forms might be more or less accessible
      to different members of the same group depending on factors like age,
      gender, background, and individual experiences. For example, expertise or
      experience in a specific domain might change the meaning and utility of
      various forms [<cite ref="saxe-1991"></cite>]. In the same vein, different
      forms can be more or less appealing or inviting to users depending on
      their background, thus creating emotional responses that color their
      entire experience with a particular design [<cite ref="norman-2004"></cite>].
   </p>
   <p>
      Finally, Saxe's framework suggests that cultural forms are malleable and
      that people are inventive in their use of them. Forms are continually
      appropriated and restructured by individuals to serve new functions in
      light of shifting goals and expectations. This opens the possibility that
      interaction designers can intentionally evoke cultural forms while at the
      same time supporting novel capabilities. Designed forms can maintain
      aspects of source cultural forms to a greater or lesser extent; however,
      the fidelity of the designed system to the source cultural form is
      critical as it affects the ability of users to recognize the underlying
      source form. In other words, if a user does not perceive the cultural form
      then potentially desirable practices and resources will remain dormant. 
   </p>
   
   <h1>RELATIONSHIP TO METAPHOR</h1>
   <p>
      The approach I propose is similar to that of metaphor, but the emphasis is
      different. One typical use of metaphor in interaction design is to draw
      parallels between common activities in order to suggest productive actions
      (or suggest the significance of such actions). However, metaphors tend to
      break down when the familiar domain ceases to match the expressiveness
      and power of the target domain [<cite ref="dourish-2001"></cite>,
      <cite ref="hornecker-2012"></cite>]. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      When an interactive system evokes a cultural form, it is not a
      metaphor. Rather, it is an actual instantiation of the source cultural
      form with a certain degree of variation involved. One way to think about
      this is that no two jigsaw puzzles are exactly alike. They vary in terms
      of material properties (wood, rubber, cardboard, plastic), shape, size,
      number of pieces, and so on. Some jigsaw puzzles have a picture that is
      revealed when the pieces are assembled, and others don't. Some jigsaw
      puzzles aren't even <i>puzzles</i> at all. The point is that the concept
      of a jigsaw puzzle is rather fuzzy, and while we could argue about whether
      a specific instance is or is not an actual jigsaw puzzle, the underlying
      cultural form is recognizable in each instance to a greater or lesser
      extent. Now imagine an interface based on a jigsaw puzzle (e.g. [<cite
      ref="horn-2012"></cite>, <cite ref="xie-2008"></cite>]). We could say
      that this interface uses a jigsaw puzzle metaphor, a mapping that
      suggests possible operations that can be performed with objects in the
      system. Another way to think about it, however, is that the interface
      (whether physical or graphical) is, in fact, a real jigsaw puzzle, not
      metaphorical representation. It just varies from source cultural form to
      some extent, and this variation affects the legibility of the form.
   </p>
   <h1>EXAMPLE 1: TANGIBLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
   <p>
      One common application of tangible interaction is in the domain of
      computer programming languages, particularly for learning purposes. These
      languages often take the form of constructive assembly
      systems [<cite ref="ullmer-2000"></cite>] in which users build physical
      algorithmic structures out of a collection of components. For
      example, McNerney [<cite ref="mcnerney-2004"></cite>] and Wyeth [<cite
      ref="wyeth-2008"></cite>] created programming systems based on LEGO
      bricks, while Horn et al. [<cite ref="horn-2012a"></cite>] used
      blocks shaped like puzzle pieces (Figure 2). Through the use
      of such artifacts, all three of these systems build on existing cultural forms.
   </p>
   <figure>
      <img src="figure2.png" style="width: 3.35in;" />
      <figcaption>
         Figure 2: The Tern tangible programming system uses puzzle pieces
         for the physical construction of computer programs.

   </figure>
   
   </div>
</div>

<div class="page">
   <div class="columns">
   <p>
      I suggest that there is more going on with these systems than simply
      embodying programming syntax or offering clear affordances and
      constraints. Because cultural forms are recognizable in these systems,
      users are able to apply a variety of well-established cognitive and
      physical resources such as the ability to correctly orient and connect
      building blocks and the knowledge that construction and assembly are
      typical goals of such systems [<cite ref="xie-2008"></cite>]. For example,
      in observations of tangible programming languages, one of the first things
      children do is to construct the longest possible chain of blocks that they
      can [<cite ref="horn-2012a"></cite>]. This is a goal that is quite
      consistent with a jigsaw puzzle-assemble all of the pieces to see the
      hidden picture that results. The forms also activate social resources such
      as the ability to share blocks, to resolve conflicts over limited
      resources (e.g. there are only three forward blocks), and to negotiate
      shared goals.
   </p>
   <p>
      Continuing with the tangible programming example, different cultural forms
      may be more or less accessible to different user groups based on
      background and prior experience. So, for example, it's possible to imagine
      a child who frequently plays with LEGOs but has never encountered a jigsaw
      puzzle before. For this child, the resources associated with the LEGO
      bricks might be more elaborate and practiced than those associated with
      the puzzle pieces. And, importantly, the three programming systems invoke
      a set of emotional resources associated with the source forms such as the
      enjoyment of play.
   </p>
   <p>
      This leads to the idea that cultural forms that may be more or less
      inviting to users. For example, Horn et al.'s [<cite
      ref="horn-2012a"></cite>] study of tangible programming systems in a
      science museum found that the tangible system was more inviting than an
      equivalent graphical system that used onscreen blocks with a computer
      mouse. Specifically, visitors (and especially kids) were more likely to
      try the exhibit with the tangible blocks than with a mouse. One possible
      explanation is that the source cultural form was more recognizable in the
      tangible system than in the graphical system. Indeed, the most salient
      aspect of the graphical system might have been the computer mouse and
      monitor&#151;an entirely different (and more polymorphic) form with
      different associated resources (including emotional resources).
      Observations of visitors interacting with the exhibit revealed differences
      in social activities between the two exhibits as well. The mouse-based
      exhibit tended to result in a more parent-driven activity, while the
      tangible exhibit tended to be more child-driven, meaning that children
      were more active in constructing various programs while parents took on
      more of a supporting role [<cite ref="horn-2012a"></cite>]. As Dourish
      explains, "a child playing with blocks engages with them in quite
      different ways than we could provide in a screen-based virtual equivalent;
      so tangible computing is exploring how to get the computer 'out of the
      way' and provide people with with a much more direct-tangible-experience"
      [<cite ref="dourish-2001"></cite>] (p.16).
   </p>
   
   <h1>EXAMPLE 2: TABLETOP MUSEUM EXHIBIT</h1>
   <p>
      The second example, also from an informal learning setting, involves the
      use of a multi-touch tabletop in a natural history museum. The activity
      presented on the tabletop is a multi-level game designed to help museum
      visitors understand concepts of evolution and phylogenetic trees (Figure
      2) [<cite ref="horn-2012b"></cite>]. Relevant to this example are 
      micro-practices surrounding video game play. From research in the Learning
      Sciences there is evidence that kids engage in rich sets of social activities
      while playing video games together [<cite ref="satwicz-2008"></cite>,
      <cite ref="stevens-2007"></cite>]. These activities include a variety of
      self-organized learning arrangements such as mentoring, intent observation,
      and inner and outer circles of play [<cite ref="stevens-2007"></cite>].
      Kids are also effectively able to coordinate a variety of quantitative
      representations common to video games to make predictions and organize
      their actions around those predictions [<cite ref="satwicz-2008"></cite>].
   </p>
   <p>
      Based on this research, there is reason to believe that if kids perceive
      the tabletop exhibit as a video game, then many of the associated
      resources of video game play should become accessible, even though the
      context is different (a natural history museum rather than a living
      room). Our analysis of children and families using the exhibit in a
      museum revealed that families employed a variety of game-like activities
      (such as play-by-play narration, coaching, and turn taking) to facilitate
      not only individual engagement, but also group engagement as well.
   </p>
   <p>
      Notably the social resources that we observed didn't always resemble what
      might be thought of as "positive" collaboration. For example, two
      brothers resorted to physically hitting one another in a
      dispute over whose turn was next. Despite this conflict, both boys stayed
      involved in the activity, even without parental intervention or oversight.
      The conflict in this case might have been a well-rehearsed form of
      negotiation to stay involved in the activity. See [<cite
      ref="fleck-2009"></cite>] for another example of surprisingly useful conflict. 
   </p>

      <img src="figure3.png" style="width: 3.35in" />

<div class="page">
   <div class="columns">
   <p>
      What is less conclusive from our observations is whether or not the
      exhibit actually helps people learn&#151;or at least learn about evolution and
      phylogenetic trees. In other words, while focused engagement is probably
      necessary for learning, it's not necessarily sufficient in this case. And,
      the micro-practices of game play, while effective at helping kids learn
      how to play and win games, may not help them learn about the target
      concepts intended by the designers. In this respect the role of the
      parents was interesting. On the one hand, many parents and adult
      chaperones seemed to discourage children from interacting with the table,
      making statements like, "we're not here to do <i>that</i>." In these
      cases, they seemed to perceive the tabletop as a video game, and, as such,
      an inappropriate activity for a trip to the natural history museum where
      there are many authentic artifacts on display that can't be seen anywhere
      else. On the other hand, other parents seemed to perceive the activity as
      more of an interactive museum exhibit designed for learning rather than a
      video game. This often led to exchanges between parents and children in
      which the goals and meaning of the exhibit were negotiated over time,
      leading to an activity that was not quite a video game and not quite a
      museum exhibit either, but something that had combined aspects of both. In
      this case, having visitors interpret the cultural form of the exhibit
      installation in slightly different ways might have been valuable to the
      overall experience.
   </p>
   <h1>EXAMPLE 3: GHOST HUNTERS</h1>
   <p>
      There are times when the goal of interaction design is to bring about
      change in culture itself. A good example of this is in the current trend
      to develop <i>eco-feedback</i> technology [<cite ref="froehlich-2010"></cite>]
      to help promote sustainable behavior. The challenge is that the
      consumption of natural resources such as gas, electricity, and water is
      largely invisible due to the nature of modern infrastructures (out of
      sight and out of mind). As a result people have poor understandings of the
      magnitude and impact of their own consumption. From one perspective, the
      goal is to bring about behavior change through feedback and reinforcement,
      an approach that emphasizes change at the level of the individual.
      However, growing attention on the interplay between social
      practices and feedback technology (e.g. [<cite ref="strengers-2011"></cite>])
      has enlarged the unit of analysis to consider families and communities as
      well as individuals.
   </p>
   <p>
      In this vein, we developed an interactive system called Ghost Hunters
      designed to engage parents and children in informal learning activities in
      which they seek out hidden sources of energy consumption in their homes.
      Our system combines an electro-magnetic field (EMF) detector with a mobile
      tablet computer. Bringing the Ghost Hunter device within range of an
      electrical current activates the detector. Families can then use an app on
      the tablet computer to keep track of the sources of energy consumption
      that they have discovered so far (Figure 4). For example, bringing the
      device within a few inches of a microwave oven on standby will make it
      vibrate and beep. However, the same microwave will activate our system
      from several feet away while heating up food.
   </p>
   <p>
      We deliberately created this design to evoke cultural forms of search
      games like hide-and-seek and I-spy-with-my-little-eye. We knew that we
      wanted to involve parents and children to-gether in exploring the home,
      and search games seemed like a good fit for the types of activities we
      were targeting&#151;one in which kids search in odd places (e.g. behind
      couches and so on) to find hidden things. In this case the hidden things
      are sources of energy consumption.
   </p>
   <p>
      However, the cultural forms in this example are different from the
      previous examples in two important ways. First, games like hide-and-seek
      don't typically involve physical artifacts. Only the players themselves
      (and of course places to hide) are necessary. A second related difference
      is that activities aren't tied to a specific location. Players are free
      (and even compelled) to explore their wider surroundings. Given these
      differences, a key question is whether or not we could create a minimal
      design that would nonetheless suggest particular forms of social
      engagement. In other words, the device itself is not particularly
      evocative, but we hoped that its manner of use in context would suggest
      familiar forms of social engagement.
   </p>
   <p>
      An evaluation with seven families revealed a variety of ways in which
      parents supported their children's learning about energy consumption. This
      included physical support (such as lifting a child up to a light on the
      ceiling), offering hints and tips, and asking leading questions. These
      types of activities are reminiscent of search games like hide-and-seek,
      but more work needs to be done to fully understand whether and how the
      design evoked specific cultural forms. However, when we asked participants
      to characterize the activity after it was over, some mentioned things like
      "hide-and-go-electrical", "treasure hunt", and "electricity hunt". Our
      design seemed successful in helping families find unexpected sources of
      electricity use, including so-called energy vampires&#151;devices that
      consume electricity on standby mode.
   </p>

</div>
<div class="page">
   <div class="columns">
   <p>
      However, our design was less effective in getting families to pay
      attention to relative consumption (by comparing across appliances) or in
      attending to the units of consumption (kilowatt hours).
      This might have been related to the forms that we evoked&#151;activities
      that encourage discovery of hidden things but not necessarily their
      comparison. Future work would involve thinking about cultural forms that
      imply the comparison of objects or quantities and attempting to integrate
      those forms into the Ghost Hunter design. 
   </p>
   
   <h1>TOWARD A DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
   <p>
      It's clear that tangible interaction designers intuitively incorporate
      cultural forms into their creations all the time, even if they don't plan
      it that way from the outset. As a case in point, the first two examples in
      this paper were not created with cultural forms in mind. It was only in
      retrospect that the role of cultural forms in shaping the interaction
      around the designs became apparent. However, the inspiration for the third
      example (Ghost Hunters) came from deliberately thinking about the kinds
      of social activities that we wanted to promote. This was followed by a
      brainstorming session in which we considered the types of cultural forms
      that might or might not produce the outcomes we were looking for.
   </p>
   <p>
      Of course, not all interactive systems can or should be designed to evoke
      cultural forms, but this approach can be valuable in situations where
      cueing certain forms social interaction is essential to the success of the
      design. To summarize the design approach: Start by considering the forms
      of social interaction that will contribute to the success of an
      interactive system. Who should be involved? What roles should they play?
      Next, think about the kinds of cultural forms that might bring about the
      desired patterns of social activity. How accessible and appealing are the
      various forms to the target audience? Formative testing that consciously
      samples a diverse population might be useful in answering these questions.
      Finally, think about the fidelity of designed forms to their
      corresponding source forms. Fidelity to source the form can have a large
      impact on the appeal of an interface to different segments of the target
      audience. Low fidelity forms may not be recognized as instances their
      source forms, thus missing out on potentially valuable practice-linked
      resources. In this respect, tangible systems have a clear advantage over
      their graphical counterparts. Through the use of physical and social
      embodiment tangible systems have greater flexibility to remain faithful
      to source forms while incorporating interactive media.
   </p>
   <h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
   <p>
      While the use of cultural forms can help shape social activity around an
      interactive system, this approach shares many of the limitations of
      affordance and metaphor in interaction design. While cultural forms can
      cue social activity, the results may or may not match desired outcomes
      exactly. For example, hide-and-seek games are great for uncovering hidden
      sources of consumption, but not so effective for getting families to
      compare consumption across different devices and appliances. Cultural
      forms are also culturally specific and open to interpretation. What works
      in one setting with one group of people may not be successful in a
      different context. Likewise, people bring into an activity their own goals
      and expectations that may or may not align with the designers' goals.
      In many cases there are no obvious or appropriate cultural forms to support
      the desired activity. The good news, of course, is that cultural forms are
      everywhere, and their use involves a wide array of activities.
   </p>
   <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
   <p>
      In this paper I have proposed an approach to tangible interaction design
      that looks beyond physical analogies and universal sensorimotor
      experiences. Specifically, I have argued that designers can purposefully
      evoke cultural forms as a means to activate existing patterns of social
      activity along with associated cognitive, physical, and emotional
      resources. This approach to design was inspired by the notion of social
      and cultural funds of knowledge [<cite ref="gonzalez-2005"></cite>,
      <cite ref="lee-2003"></cite>] and by Saxe's form-function shift
      framework [<cite ref="saxe-1991"></cite>, <cite ref="saxe-1999"></cite>].
      Using three examples I demonstrated what this might look like in action.
